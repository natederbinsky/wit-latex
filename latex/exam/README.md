Exam2
=====
Produces an exam.

**Note**: identical to the `wit_exam` class (see `old`) aside from minor cosmetic changes.

## Usage
See the example **exam2.tex** and **calc2.tex** documents

1. `\documentclass{wit_exam2}`
2. ...
3. `\author{ **your name here** }`
4. `\title{ **exam name here** }`
5. `\date{ **semester designation here** }`
6. `\course{ **course code here** }{ **course name here** }`
7. ...
8. `\ExamInstruction{ **Instruction text here** }`
9. ...
10. `\ProblemDeclaration{ **Problem name here** }{ **Points here** }`
11. `\BonusDeclaration{ **Problem name here** }{ **Points here** }`
12. ...
13. `\begin{document}`
14. ...
15. `\begin{ProblemDefinition}[ **Optional instructions here** ]`
16. ...
17. `\end{ProblemDefinition}`
18. ...
19. `\end{document}`

### ExamInstruction
Use this command for each instruction you would like listed on the title page. If no instructions are provided, the section will not display.

### Declaration
The `\ProblemDeclaration` and `\BonusDeclaration` commands function identically, but the latter will not add to the total number of available points. As such, the `\ProblemDefinition` command should be used independent of which declaration was used.

### ProblemDefinition
The optional argument provides an italicized instruction block below the problem section header. Any valid LaTeX commands can be used within this environment.

### Solution Mode
An optional feature (not available in `old`) is to provide solution information -- that is, content that is only shown when the document is in "solution" mode.

To show solution mode, use the `\MakeSolution` command in the document header (the title will be adjusted to reflect the mode).

To create solution-only content, two commands have been supplied:
* `\IfSolution` ... `\fi`: any commands between these commands will only be shown in the solution. This is the more general command.
* `\Answer{ **Text Here** }`: Outputs a bolded value only in solution mode.
