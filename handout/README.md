Handout
=======
A Microsoft Word template for handouts.

To change front matter, change the file Properties. The custom fields (Assignment, Professor, Semester, ClassName, and ClassNumber) control the main document header, as well as each page's header. Note: you will likely need to select-all + Update Field after modifying these values for them to take effect.
