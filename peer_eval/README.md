## Usage
As an overview, students individually fill out and submit evaluation forms (`evaluation_form.docx`) and these results are entered into a grade matrix of appropriate group size (`grade_matrix.xlsx`). Once the group grade is entered, as well as the proportion of redistribution due to peer evaluation, the individual grade for each student is automatically computed.

### Evaluation Form
An example form is provided in Microsoft Word (`evaluation_form.docx`). First, unprotect the document (no password required) and make any desired changes. Then, protect the document (optionally with a password) and distribute to the students for them to complete.

### Grade Matrix
The grade matrix (`grade_matrix.xlsx`) includes templates for groups of size {2, 3, 4}. For each group, make a copy of the appropriate worksheet. Within the worksheet, associate each student with a row/column number and analogously change the M# label. For each evaluation form, fill in the values from the form along the author's **row**. Finally, fill in the group grade and the proportion of the grade to redistribute (0-1.0) and the individual student grades will be computed automatically along the columns.
